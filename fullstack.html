      <h1>What is Full stack development?</h1>
      <p>
        Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend
        and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend
        (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component.
        The frontend contains the user interface and code related to user
        interactions with the application. The backend contains all the code
        required for the application to run, including integrations with data
        systems, communicating with other applications, and processing data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Full stack developers are responsible for both the frontend and backend
        of applications. They have a wide range of skills and can work on all
        aspects of an application, from the user interface to the server-side
        logic and database management.
      </p>
      <h2>What are the technologies used in full-stack development?</h2>
      <p>The technologies that a full-stack developer uses will change depending on the focus area. Below are the differences between frontend and backend technologies.</p>
      <h4>Frontend: </h4>
      <p>Frontend technology (or client software) focuses on the client-facing side of development. You code any parts of the graphical user interface (GUI) or the features that users interact with using frontend technology.</p>
      <section class="container my-5">
  <h2 class=""">The most common frontend languages are: </h2>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    <li class="list-group-item"> <strong> 1: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> </strong></li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong> 2: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)  </strong>  </li>
    <li class="list-group-item"> <strong> 3: JavaScript </strong> </li>
  </ul>
</section> 
<h4>Backend: </h4>
 <p>Backend technology (or server software) coordinates the exchange of information between the frontend and the server running a webpage. It allows an application to communicate with the main server. The most common backend languages are Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), Ruby, Java, and Python. However, there are many more programming languages and technologies that can be used for different requirements. </p>
      <section class="container my-5">
  <h2 class=""">You can group backend technology into three sub-layers: </h2>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    <li class="list-group-item"> <strong> 1)API layer :</strong>  The API layer receives interactions from the frontend and then communicates these to the storage layer. This layer acts as a bridge between the frontend and the backend.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong> 2)Storage layer: </strong> The storage layer manages and stores any application data. It will communicate with databases to write and read data, while providing access to data. A notification layer will send notifications from the frontend to the backend and vice versa. This allows an application to communicate and trigger responses </li>
    <li class="list-group-item"> <strong> 3)Business logic layer:  </strong> The business logic layer is the main core of the backend. Backend developers configure processing logic in this layer, changing the response a certain API request delivers. </li>
  </ul>
